## Testing the speed of gravity with black hole ringdown
Presentations based on the paper [[2301.10272]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10272), where we investigate how the speed of gravitational waves can be tested with ringdown observations. We focus on odd parity quasinormal modes of hairy black holes in Horndeski theories.
